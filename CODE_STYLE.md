# Code Style Guide

This project follows the Google C++ style guide for maintaining consistency and readability of the codebase. Adhering to a consistent coding style is crucial for collaboration and maintainability.

## Google C++ Style Guide

Google's C++ style guide provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for writing clean and maintainable C++ code. Please refer to the official guide for detailed information:

[Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

## Editor Configuration

To ensure consistency and simplify adherence to the coding style, consider configuring your code editor or IDE to use formatting settings that align with the Google C++ style guide. Popular editors often have plugins or built-in support for defining and enforcing code style rules.

For instance, consider using:

- **Clang-Format**: Utilize the `.clang-format` file based on the Google C++ style guide to automatically format your code.
- **IDE Plugins**: Editors like Visual Studio Code, CLion, and others have plugins available to enforce coding style guidelines.

## Recommendations

- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency within the codebase. Adhering to the same style guide ensures readability and easier collaboration.
- **Respect Existing Style**: If the project already has established styles, follow those. Consistency within the project takes precedence over external style guides.

## Google C++ Style Guide Highlights

Some key points from the Google C++ style guide include but are not limited to:

- Naming conventions for variables, functions, classes, etc.
- Indentation, brace placement, and spacing rules.
- Commenting and documentation practices.

For a detailed understanding, please refer directly to the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and apply the specified conventions to your contributions.

Following a consistent code style guide across the project ensures maintainability and ease of collaboration. Thank you for adhering to these guidelines!

Happy Coding!
